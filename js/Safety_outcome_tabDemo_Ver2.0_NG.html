        <h2>Children's Bureau</h2>
        <h3>Child and Family Services Reviews</h3>
        <h3>Onsite Review Instrument and Instructions</h3>
        <h3>General Instructions</h3>

         <div>
            <p> The Onsite Review Instrument and Instructions is used to review both foster care and in-home
                services cases during the onsite review component of the Child and Family Services Reviews
                (CFSRs) of state child welfare agencies. In completing the instrument, reviewers will conduct
                case file reviews and case-related interviews with children, parents, foster parents,
                caseworkers, and other professionals involved with the child.</p>
            <p> The instrument is organized into a Face Sheet and three sections.  On the Face Sheet,
                reviewers document general information about a case, such as the type of case. The three
                sections focus on the outcome domains that form the basis of the CFSRs: safety, permanency,
                and child and family well-being.  For each outcome, reviewers collect information on a number
                of “items” related to that outcome.</p>
             <p> Although reviewers use the instrument to review both foster care and in-home services cases,
                they should complete the permanency section only if the case under review is a foster care
                case. If reviewing an in-home services case, reviewers should select Not Applicable as the
                rating for the permanency items.</p>
             <p>For children in foster care, reviewers should consider the safety items (1 through 3) for all
                children in the family, but complete the permanency items (4 through 11) and the child and
                family well-being items (12 through 18) only as they apply to the specific child whose case is
                under review.  For children receiving in-home services, reviewers should apply the safety and
                child and family well-being items to all the children in the family who are residing with, and
                included in services to, the family.</p>
         
        <h3>Reviewing the Case</h3>
        <p>Reviewers must answer all the questions for each applicable item.  If the question is Not
            Applicable to the case, then NA should be marked for that question.</p>
        <p>Reviewers must indicate the source(s) of the information used to determine their responses to
            the item questions. The instrument provides some instructions on where to find information.
            Reviewers should use their professional judgment to determine how best to gather all the
            relevant information.  Further instructions for answering the questions relating to the individual
            items are provided below the relevant question. Reviewers should read all instructions carefully
            before responding to questions.</p>

                or is of two or more races and only one is noted in the file (for example, Non-Hispanic instead of Hispanic,
                or both White and Native American), please change the race or ethnicity identification information

            <h4>Question G Instructions:</h4>
            <ul>
                    <li>The case is a foster care case if the target child was in foster care at any time during the period under
                        review.  A child is considered to be in foster care if the state child welfare agency (hereafter "the agency")
                        has placement and care responsibility for the child.  This includes a child who is placed by the agency with
                        relatives or in other kin-type placements, but the agency maintains placement and care responsibility.  It
                        does not include a child who is living with relatives (or caregivers other than parents) but who is not under
                        the care and placement responsibility of the agency.</li>
                    <li>The case is an in-home services case if no child in the family was in foster care at any time during the

		  <div id="accordion1_1">
			    <h3>Step 1: Purpose of Assessment</h3>
				  <div>
					   <p>To determine whether responses to all accepted child maltreatment reports received during the period under review were initiated, and face-to-face contact with the child made, within the time frames established by agency policies or state statutes.
					</p>
				  </div>

				  <h3>Step 2: Item 1 Applicable Cases</h3>
				  <div>
					   <ul>
						    <li>Cases are applicable for an assessment of this item if an accepted child maltreatment report on any child in the family was received during the period under review. "Accepted" means that the report was assigned to the agency to conduct an assessment or investigation. This includes reports assigned for an "alternative response" assessment. Reports that are screened out are not considered "accepted." "Alternative response" refers to an agency's approach to addressing child maltreatment reports that meet agency criteria for acceptance but at the initial screening do not meet the agency's requirements for a mandated investigation. For example, the agency's policy may be that reports that appear to present low to moderate risk to the child may be referred for a family assessment, rather than an investigation. Under such a response, no determination of child maltreatment is made. The alternative response may include an assessment to determine the safety of the children, the risk of maltreatment, and the family's strengths and needs. The assessment may lead the state agency to provide services to eliminate or lessen the safety concerns and maltreatment risks. 

						    </li>
						    <li>Cases are Not Applicable for an assessment of this item if, during the period under review, there were no child maltreatment reports on any child in the family, or if a report was received on a child in the family but it was "screened out"; that is, not referred for an assessment or investigation. 

						    </li>

          Question 2A Definitions: 
        </b></p>

        <ul>
          <li>"Appropriate services"for purposes of item 2 are those that are provided to, or arranged for, the family withthe explicit goal of ensuring the child's safety. Some examples include: (1) if there are safety issues in thehome due to environmental hazards, homemaking services could be an appropriate safety-related service; (2) if there are safety concerns related to the parent's ability to manage specific child needs or childbehaviors, intensive in-home services could be an appropriate safety-related service; (3) child care services could be a safety-related service in cases where the child was being cared for in an unsafe setting or by an inappropriate caregiver; and (4) if there are safety concerns related to parental substance abuse, substance abuse treatment could be an appropriate safety-related service. If a child needs mental health services, education-related services, or services to address health issues, in most cases these would not be considered relevant to the child's safety if the child remained in the home. Efforts of the agency to meetthese service needs are assessed in other items. </li>

          <li>"Concerted efforts"for purposes of item 2 refers to the following activities: Working to engage families inneeded services, and facilitating a family's access to those services.</li>

          <li> In responding to question B, determine whether ongoing assessments (formal or informal) were conducted during the period under review.  If the agency conducted an initial assessment of risk and safety at the onset of the case, but did not assess for risk and safety concerns on an ongoing basis (for example, when there were new allegations of abuse or neglect, changing family conditions, new people coming into the family home or having access to the children, changes to visitation, upon reunification, or at case closure) then the answer to question B should be No.
                    </li>

          <li>Note that in some cases, the issue of ongoing assessments may not be relevant because the case was opened for a very short period of time (for example, if the case was opened shortly before the end of the period under review and during the initial assessment the agency determined that there were no risk or safety concerns, then it may be reasonable to conclude that the agency would not have conducted a second risk and safety assessment during the period under review).  In this case, determine whether the agency conducted ongoing assessments of both risk and safety and, if not, whether it should have, given the time frame and circumstances of the case. If you believe that ongoing assessments were not necessary, question B may be answered Not Applicable.
